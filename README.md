# cs50-projects
All the projects from my Fall 2023 CS50 course at Harvard

The course offers a rigourous introduction to programming starting with C to build foundations for algorithms, and then progresses to Python, SQL, and Javascript implementations with Flask. The course also covers HTML and CSS, and concludes with a long-term project to build a web application.
